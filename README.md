# My blog

My blog made with the [Hugo theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). It uses [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) feature to load the theme.

## Install

When installing the template from the CaiJimmy's template, we must configure the github pages, to have: github actions.
Once it is done, we must add "url" infos in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
